# Split Ticket Ballots
Olin College SP20 Data Science Final Project.
## Summary
This project uses data from the [ANES dataset](https://electionstudies.org/data-center/) to explore the frequency of split-ticket voting over time and to examine potential factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of split-ticket voting.

The [report](https://github.com/anushadatar/split-ticket/blob/master/report.md) contains a high-level description of the project and its results. The [Cleaning and Validation notebook](https://github.com/anushadatar/split-ticket/blob/master/Prepare-Dataset.ipynb) and [Analysis notebook](https://github.com/anushadatar/split-ticket/blob/master/Analysis.ipynb) contain additional detail.
