# Split Ticket Ballots
Olin College SP20 Data Science Final Project.
## Summary
This project uses data from the [ANES dataset](https://electionstudies.org/data-center/) to explore the frequency of split-ticket voting over time and to examine potential factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of split-ticket voting.

## Dataset Terms of Use
The ANES dataset has the following terms of use, which I accept:
- Use these datasets solely for research or statistical purposes and not for investigation of specific survey respondents.
- Make no use of the identity of any survey respondent(s) discovered intentionally or inadvertently, and to advise ANES of any such discovery (anes@electionstudies.org)
- Cite ANES data and documentation in your work that makes use of the data and documentation. Authors of publications based on ANES data should send citations of their published works to ANES for inclusion in our bibliography of related publications.
- You acknowledge that the original collector of the data, ANES, and the relevant funding agency/agencies bear no responsibility for use of the data or for interpretations or inferences based upon such uses.
